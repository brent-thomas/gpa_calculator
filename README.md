# GPA Calculator
A web application designed for students to log and view grades. Built with React, Vite, and an AWS RDS database.

**Quick PSA!** As of 10/26/2023, the database is alive and kicking. But given the costs, it'll probably retire to a sunny beach in a few weeks. You'll still have the frontend, though! I'd host it all forever, but apparently, AWS doesn't accept good vibes as payment. ðŸ¤·
